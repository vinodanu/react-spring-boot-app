# React Spring Boot App

This repository contains a full-stack web application built with React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The application serves as an example of integrating these technologies to create a modern and scalable web application.

## Features

- **Frontend**: The `frontend` folder contains the React code for the frontend of the application. It demonstrates best practices for creating a responsive and interactive user interface using React, along with popular libraries like React Router and Axios for routing and API communication.

- **Backend**: The `backend` folder contains the Spring Boot code for the backend of the application. It showcases how to build RESTful APIs using Spring Web, and includes components such as controllers, services, and repositories. The backend also utilizes Spring Security for authentication and authorization.

- **Database**: The application uses an embedded H2 database for simplicity, allowing the application to run without any external database setup. The database schema and initial data are provided in the `backend/src/main/resources/data.sql` file.

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vinodanu/react-spring-boot-app.git
   ```

2. **Frontend setup**: Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run the following commands:

   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies and start the frontend development server.

3. **Backend setup**: In a separate terminal, navigate to the `backend` folder and run the following command:

   ```
   cd backend
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   This will download the required dependencies and start the backend server.

4. **Access the application**: Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the React frontend. The frontend will communicate with the backend running on `http://localhost:8080`.
